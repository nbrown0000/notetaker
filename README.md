# Notetaker
A notetaking app to keep track of all your notes

## The vision
A notetaking app to organise notes in multiple ways:
- notes kept inside projects
- due dates
- reminders
- importance (high, medium, low)

## Technology stack
This project was built using:
- Front End - React, Redux
- Back End - NodeJS and ExpressJS

## The Journey
Started simple with a group of todos. Let's keep a list of these called Notes.
Lets expand our organising to have a group of Notes and call them Lists.

React is awesome! Using state and create components is so quick and effecitve. Add a splash of css here and there!

Built Node and Express back-end to provide service for this front-end.

Now it's getting more complicated I need more powerful state management. Enter Redux! And this is a whole other thing. But once you get the hang of it its actually pretty straight forward.

Tinkered with the css some more, added some icons.

Basic MVP functionality works. Still requires a bit of work:
- Add testing
- polish styling a bit
- publish to hosting
